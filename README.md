# Machine Learning Notebook

Tools I use in Machine Learning, all packaged up and ready to go.

Note: This pulls bleeding-edge versions of everything.
It will probably break and then I'll start pinning versions.
If you send me a note on twitter I'm happy to help debug issues with it.

The exception to this is TensorFlow, which is fixed to the version in its url.
If someone has a better way to solve this, let me know on Twitter!
I could build it from scratch but this docker build takes long enough already.
